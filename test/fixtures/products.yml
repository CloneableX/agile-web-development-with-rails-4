  description:
    The Pragmatic Programmers classic is back! Freshly updated for modern
    software development, <em>Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 With JUnit</em>
    teaches you how to write and run easily maintained unit tests in JUnit
    with confidence. You’ll learn mnemonics to help you know what tests to
    write, how to remember all the boundary conditions, and what the
    qualities of a good test are. You’ll see how unit tests can pay off by
    allowing you to keep your system code clean, and you’ll learn how to
    handle the stuff that seems too tough to test.
